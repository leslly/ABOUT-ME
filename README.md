April,2022 - May,2022. I join a program called Global Enterprise Experience to get the ropes on whats it is like to work with a tem on a project. 
At first it felt like i could not get along or in better terms be carried along , I was really confused but eventually i learn that if i do not 
make contributions wth good points that will get the attention of others in the team then i will not be carried along with the project.
Because i was still in school and in the middle of the semester coupled with examinations i did not contribute as much as i wish i could.
In the end the most i contributed to the project was the naming of the project, design of our website with use of Wix (i didn't do that.
just provided ideas but did nnothing hands-on) and created a software model for the project using Enterprise Architect.
Overall working experience with a team that was not in school was many things. confusing, exciting, character building and fulfilling.

March, 2022 . I join my school Enactus team and am currently part of the competitors for the FordC3 competition. There will be a one month long summer 
boot camp which i will be attendidng to pursue this competition. 

September, 2022 - Registered for the ADA project. The Ada protect is a women empowerment program by Enugu tech hub. It is a seven month mentorship program.
