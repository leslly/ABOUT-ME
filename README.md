# ABOUT-ME
Hi!, my name is Leslie.I aspire to be a software developer and my main interests lie in Java programming language.
In the past two years at Babcock university i have learn the basics of programming language like C Programming language, C.PP, .NET and java. 
As well as standard markup language HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I am currently improving my java development skills with JetBrains Academy and working on my web development skills with FreeCodeCamp.
Ihvae finish a finish an executive briefing course on Cyber Security om PluralSight and am currently on another course of web development.

April,2022 - May,2022. I join a program called Global Enterprise Experience to get the ropes on whats it is like to work with a tem on a project. 
At first it felt like i could not get along or in better terms be carried along , I was really confused but eventually i learn that if i do not 
make contributions wth good points that will get the attention of others in the team then i will not be carried along with the project.
Because i was still in school and in the middle of the semester coupled with examinations i did not contribute as much as i wish i could.
In the end the most i contributed to the project was the naming of the project, design of our website with use of Wix (i didn't do that.
just provided ideas but did nnothing hands-on) and created a software model for the project using Enterprise Architect.
Overall working experience with a team that was not in school was many things. confusing, exciting, character building and fulfilling.

March, 2022 - present. I join my school Enactus team and am currently part of the competitors for the FordC3 competition. There will be a one month long summer 
boot camp which i will be attendidng to pursue this competition. 

I'll be entering my third year of school and actively looking for places to intern between january,2023 to june, 2023 for the purpose of self development 
and academic reasons. In my time at school i have gain knowldge in topics i believe are noteable to software engineers like software ethics, SDLC, Software modelling,
Software security, programming language(s)--as mentioned above on the first paragraph.

I have zero working experience at a physical company and have never taken any jobs remotely. i know only what i have been taught in school and taught myself
but very ready to learn and explore. 

The first time i came in contact with the programming world was in school and so am not professional in any thing but i know the basic of evrything i have been taught
and have never had dificulty in coding in any of them aside the normal frustrations every programmer goes through.
